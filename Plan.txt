THE PLAN!!!

MVP:
	ROSTER for 3 sports, with (10?) teams each.
		Volleyball
		Tennis
		Basketball
	The program must be able to read multiple files filled with the different teams rosters.
	It also must be able to search and output specific information from each team when called upon in a search.
	The program will auto generate a tournement schedule based on inputed seeds for each team / or a pool play situation

STRETCH GOALS:
	1.	Be able to put in information about game play and have it be recorded as a game transcript? 
				std::cin >> p1 >> p2;
				cin event, team, p1, p2
				Sub h 10 13
				3pt h 13
	2.	Individual player stat updates by live user input, Positional statistics.
	3.	Visual Volleyball court tracking
